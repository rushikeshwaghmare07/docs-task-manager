# Document Task Manager App

## Overview

This is a **Document Task Manager app** built using **React.js**. It allows users to manage tasks related to document uploads and downloads. The UI features a background display with a title, while the foreground shows task cards where users can interact with different tasks, such as downloading or uploading files. Each task displays a description, file size, and status (open or closed).


## Features

- Responsive Design: Adapts to screen sizes using utility-first CSS with Tailwind.
- Document Task Management: Displays cards for each document-related task with action buttons.
- Dynamic Task Cards: Cards can show either "Download Now" or "Upload" status based on task data.
- Separation of Concerns: The app splits functionality into background and foreground components for better organization.
